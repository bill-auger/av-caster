    <td rowspan="2"><h2><i>A light-weight native gStreamer GUI for screencast, webcam, and audio streaming</i></h2>
    AvCaster is built upon the <a href="https://www.juce.com/">JUCE</a> framework, utilizing <a href="https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/">gStreamer</a> as the media backend and <a href="http://www.ulduzsoft.com/libircclient/">libircclient</a> as the chat backend.  It is currently capable of recording to file or streaming to an RTMP server with screen capture (full-screen), webcam (full-screen or overlay), and audio (mono or stereo).  It is moderately configurable, with preset configurations for streaming via popular servers such as <a href="https://www.livecoding.tv/">livecoding.tv</a>, and allows custom user-defined configurations to be stored as additional presets.  This initial implementation is only compatible with GNU/Linux, but it has been designed for portability.  Let us know if it would interest you to see AvCaster ported to another platform (e.g. Windows, Mac, mobile) by leaving a note on the relevant <a href="https://github.com/bill-auger/av-caster/issues?q=is%3Aopen+milestone%3A%22cross-platform+version%22+label%3Aepic">Cross-platform Milestone</a> issue.

### Motivation
The motivation behind this project is that streaming with a feature-rich, bleeding-edge client such as the [OBS Open Broadcster Software](https://obsproject.com/) and the classic [FMLE Flash Media Live Encoder](https://www.adobe.com/products/flash-media-encoder.html) is very CPU intensive even on reasonably capable computers.  Those are well suited as a substitute for dedicated capture hardware in high-performance scenarios such as game-casting; but in less demanding scenarios such as live performance, design-casting, and code-casting there is more utility in reserving your CPU cycles for primary tasks such as audio processing, graphics rendering, or source code compiling.

A command-line solution is the obvious choice for such scenarios but is obviously not as user-friendly and lacking real-time control and preview.  The primary design goal for AvCaster is to strike a reasonable balance between headless performance and full-featured graphical convenience.


### Get AvCaster
_NOTE: AvCaster requires gStreamer >= v1.6.0 and the non-free 'ugly' plugins which may not be available in your standard main/free repository (see "runtime dependencies" for your distro below).  These packages may be available in third-party repositories for some distros; but use of third-party repositories can neither be supported nor endorsed.  For this reason we are currently supporting only Arch , Debian/Ubuntu , and OpenSuse/Suse._
#### AvCaster Package Repositories
The [OpenSuse Build Service][obs] hosts AvCaster x86 and x86-64 binary package repositories for the following distributions:
  * Debian 8 , Ubuntu 16.04
  * Fedora 23
  * OpenSuse Tumbleweed , Suse SLE 12

Follow the [instructions][obs] there to subscribe your package manager or download the latest package for your distribution directly.  Let us know if you would like packaging for another distribution or architecture.
#### Other GNU/Linux:
Refer to "Building from Source" below.


### Community Support
AvCaster is a free and open-source community project and is still very much in its infancy; so testers, comments, and suggestions are appreciated.  Pull requests are quite welcomed and any submissions that advance the project toward is proposed milestones will be accepted.  If there is significant community support for this project, it could be transfered to a github organization, an IRC and/or gitter chat could be established, a website could be created, an so on.  Let us hear your ideas.  If you would like to help to improve AvCaster, we could especially use your help in the following areas:
  * developers/consultants (especially with gStreamer expertise)
  * designers (logo , website , GUI graphics/layout)
  * beta testers (anyone who streams regularly)
  * HOWTO documentation and screencasts

In any case you can "Star" this repo above if you like this project or "Watch" the repo or visit the home page of the [AvCaster Wiki][wiki] for updates.


### Getting Help / Bug Reporting
If AvCaster refuses to launch after changing some parameters in the GUI you can try deleting the persistent configuration file in your user AppData dir (e.g. ~/.config/av-caster/av-caster.bin).

Please report any problems on the [AvCaster Issue Tracker][tracker].

Feel free join the [Gitter Chat][gitter] to post any questions or comments or, well ... just chat.

### Similar Projects
There were several similar projects considered for expansion before this project was launched fresh.  They all can capture and mux in audio but they capture screen only (no webcam/text/logo) and only two of them feature a real-time preview.  They are ordered roughly by feature-set from most to least capable in terms of the AvCaster project's feature requirements.
  * [SimpleScreenRecorder](https://github.com/MaartenBaert/ssr) - feature-rich with real-time preview
  * [gtk-recordmydesktop](http://recordmydesktop.sourceforge.net/) - feature-rich with real-time preview
  * [kazam](https://launchpad.net/kazam) - feature-rich but no preview
  * [vokoscreen](http://www.kohaupt-online.de/hp/) - similar features as kazam with pretty and intutive GUI
  * [ffmpeg-gui](http://sourceforge.net/projects/ffmpegfrontend/) - cross-platform QT basic ffmpeg launcher
  * [ffmpeggui](http://sourceforge.net/projects/ffmpeg-gui/) - Win32 basic ffmpeg launcher

Also, the ffmpeg bash script that AvCaster was originally conceived to wrap is in [this gist](https://gist.github.com/bill-auger/9480205a38d9d00d2fa3) if an ultra-lightweight command-line webcasting tool is more suitable.  It is capable of recording to file or streaming to an RTMP server with screen capture, webcam, text overlay, and stereo audio.  It requires some manual configuration o/c, but is approximately twice as nice.
