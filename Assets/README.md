### AvCaster Assets Licenses

The original audio, video, and image files in the AvCaster Assets/ directory are licensed under [version 3 of the GNU General Public License](COPYING_ASSETS)
with the "sources" or "preferred form" explicitly defined to be any and all
binary data, meta-data, editor project files, scripts, and source code of custom executables
that are necessary to accomplish all of the following using only widely-available free software:
* regenerate the associated target artifacts completely and accurately
* modify these "preferred form" decomposed sources directly and individually
* compose the original and modified sources
* generate equivalent modified versions of the associated target artifacts

For example:
* "target artifact" such as a composed (mixed-down) .png, .svg, .wav, etc (these are typically all that is covered by a Crerative Commons licencse)
* "binary data" such as the individual elements that compose the "target artifact" (images, sound tracks, etc.)
* "editor project files" such as .xcf, .psd, .aup, .ardour, etc.
* "meta-data", "scripts", and "source code of custom executables" such as 3D models, openGL shaders, etc.
* "widely-available free software" such as GIMP, Inkscape, Audacity, Ardour, etc.


Exceptions:
* config.xcf, config-btn.png, config-hover.png, config-pushed.png (wrench images)
    these are derrived from the [tango desktop project's](http://tango-project.org/) preferences-system.png
