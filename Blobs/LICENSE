GPLv3 Free Culture Addendum

The original multimedia files in the AvCaster Blobs/ directory
are licensed under version 3 of the GNU General Public License (GPLv3).
The terminology in section 1 of the GPLv3 (namely: "object code", "source code",
and "preferred form"), as it relates to the binary data of this project,
is explicitly defined below.

The "object code" is explicitly defined here to be the binary files
(audio, video, images, 3D models, fonts, etc.), which are loaded by
or embedded into the AvCaster program.

The "source code" or "preferred form of the work" is explicitly defined here,
to be any and all resources (such as binary data, editor project files,
meta-data, declarative texts, scripts, and source code of helper programs),
which are necessary to accomplish all of the following tasks,
using only widely-available free software:

  * regenerate the associated "object code" artifacts, completely and accurately
  * modify the fully decomposed "preferred form" sources, directly and independently
  * compose the original, modified, and replacement sources, interchangeably
  * generate equivalent modified versions of the associated artifacts

Examples of "object code" artifacts, and "source code"
(or the "preferred form of the work") include:

  * "artifacts":
    such as a composed (mixed-down) .webm, .png, .ogg, .wav, etc
  * "binary data":
    such are the individual elements which compose the "artifacts"
    (image layers, sound tracks, audio samples, etc.)
  * "meta-data" and "declarative texts":
    such as 3D models, animations, edit-decision-lists/cue-sheets, CSS, etc.
  * "scripts" and "source code of helpers":
    such as ImageMagick scripts, GIMP plugins, openGL shaders, etc.
  * "editor project files":
    such as .blend, .xcf, .psd, .aup, .ardour, etc.
  * "widely-available free software":
    such as Blender, GIMP, Inkscape, Audacity, Ardour, etc.

The definitions above should not be construed as exhaustive. However, the
intention is analogous to the GPL distinction of complete corresponding source
code vs. compiled binary executables. Likewise, with any digital art-form, it is
assumed to be self-evident to any competent digital artist, which properties
generally qualify the prepared end-results, ready for end-user consumption,
as distinct from everything else, which would not be particularly interesting
to a consumer, but would be significantly helpful or essential to a producer.
This addendum explicitly requires that: "everything else".
